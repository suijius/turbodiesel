Supportability
==============

Maintainability (i.e. “build-time” issues)
- Testability – at unit, integration, and system levels
- Buildability – fast build times, versioning robustness
- Portability – minimal vendor or platform dependency
- Reusability – of components
- Brandability - OEM and partner support
- Internationalization – prep for localization

Serviceability (i.e. “run-time” issues)
- Continuity – administrative downtime constraints
- Configurability/Modifiability – of fielded product
- Installability, Updateability – ensuring application integrity
- Deployability – mode of distributing updates
- Restorability - from archives
- Logging – of event or debug data
