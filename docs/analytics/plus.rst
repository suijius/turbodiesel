Design, Implementation, Interface, and Physical Requirements
The "+" in the FURPS+ acronym is used to identify additional categories that generally represent constraints.
A design requirement, often called a design constraint, specifies or constrains the options for designing a system. For example, if you specify that a relational database is required, that's a design constraint.
An implementation requirement specifies or constrains the coding or construction of a system. Examples might include required standards, implementation languages, and resource limits.
An interface requirement specifies an external item with which a system must interact, or constraints on formats or other factors used within such an interaction.
A physical requirement specifies a physical constraint imposed on the hardware used to house the system Â— shape, size, or weight, for example.
